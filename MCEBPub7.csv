Enter the equipment type code followed by the equipment system or component nomenclature for the transmitter location. (If available, the system nomenclature is preferred rather than the component nomenclature; however, either is acceptable. Data items 340 and 343 are interrelated, and an entry in Data Item 340 should be accompanied by a corresponding entry in Data Item 343, if known. If Data Item 343 is known, enter the nomenclature exactly as it is recorded in the Spectrum Certification System (SCS) database or J-12 document DD Form 1494.)
